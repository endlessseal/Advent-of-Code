AoC challenges in Python

Sometimes I have my inputs in a seperate text file, and I choose to parse it one line at a time for future proofing (if the text file is massive and I don't want to load it all into RAM). Sometimes I will read the whole file at once, or I will provide the data in the script itself. 

Sometimes the difference between part 1 and 2 is just a word change or a function drop, sure I can create flags to condense it into one script, but eh...
